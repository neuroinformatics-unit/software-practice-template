# Exercise 2
This exercise will show how to do write a docstring.

## Setup
We suggest using [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html), i.e. the Numpy style guide for docstrings.
Checkout a new branch named `add-docstring` using `git`.

```bash
git checkout -b add-docstring
```

## Write a docstring
The method `calculate_fastest_time` in `times.py` doesn't have a docstring. Based on your understanding of the method, write a docstring using Numpy formatting. Describe what the method does, what are the inputs and the outputs.

## Submit a Pull Request
Once you have completed or made progress on the exercise, commit your changes, push them to your fork and open a pull request and ask for a review.

Create a **pull request (PR)** from your branch to `UCL-bioimage-analysis/rse-best-practices-playground` [using the GitHub web interface](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Add a meaningful title to that PR and a link to this issue: `UCL-bioimage-analysis/rse-best-practices-playground#2`.

## [Optional 1] Review a Pull Request
If you already completed the above exercise, you can review a PR from another participant. You can find the submitted PRs in the [GitHub interface](
    https://www.github.com/UCL-bioimage-analysis/rse-best-practices-playground/pulls).

## [Optional 2] Write docstrings for other methods
If you have time, write docstrings for the other methods in `times.py` and submit a new PR.
