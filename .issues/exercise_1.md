# Exercise 1

## Setup your playground

Please follow these instructions step-by-step.

### Fork this repository

### Clone your repository locally

In a `bash` terminal on your computer, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/rse-best-practices-playground.git
```

Check that this worked by listing the contents of your current directory. Run
```bash
ls
```
A folder named `rse-best-practices-playground` should be listed.

(If this does not work, you may have to set up a personal access token: Follow the instructions [in the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) and get in touch with the course organisers if you encounter issues.)

### Create a conda environment for your playground

In your command line, run

```{.bash}
conda create -n "software-good-practice-course" python=3.11
```
```{.bash}
conda activate software-good-practice-course
```

The next exercises will be described in the issues of the original repository (the one you made your fork from).
### (Optional) Have a look at the code

You may want to study the code in `times.py`. You can find it by navigating to `rse-best-practices-playground` > `rse_best_practices_playground` > `times.py`. Can you figure out what the code is meant to do?
