# Exercise 4
For this exercise, we will look at how to rewrite (refactor) existing code in different ways, and what benefits each new structure offers.

## Let's refactor!
According to what was presented in the slides, do you see ways to reduce duplication?
Focus on the method `print_fastest_time` in `times.py`.

## Review your changes
Run your script. Does it still behave as expected?
**Do your tests still pass?**

## Submit a Pull Request
Once you have completed or made progress on the exercise, commit your changes, push them to your fork and open a pull request and ask for a review.

Create a **pull request (PR)** from your branch to `rse-best-practices-course-2023/rse-best-practices-playground` [using the GitHub web interface](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Add a meaningful title to that PR and a link to this issue: `rse-best-practices-course-2023/rse-best-practices-playground#4`.


## [Optional 1] Review a Pull Request
If you already completed the above exercise, you can review a PR from another participant. You can find the submitted PRs in the [GitHub interface](
    https://www.github.com/rse-best-practices-course-2023/rse-best-practices-playground/pulls).

## [Optional 2] Refactor other methods
If you have time, refactor the other methods in `times.py` and submit a new PR.
