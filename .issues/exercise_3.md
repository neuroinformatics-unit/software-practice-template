# Exercise 3
For this exercise, we will look at how to rewrite (refactor) existing code in different ways, and what benefits each new structure offers.

## Some reading
How to write better code? People have interrogated themselves on this question a lot and they came up with a set of useful principles to guide their craft.
One of them is [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), another one is the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) (part of [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)).
Another good read at this stage is [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), the style guide for python code.

## Let's refactor!
According to what you have been reading, do you see ways to improve the methods in `times.py`?

## Review your changes
Run your script. Does it still behave as expected?
Do your tests still pass? Do they still map to the new methods you have created?
Are your docstrings still reflecting the behaviour of your methods?

## Final tasks
Commit your changes!
Create a pull request from your branch to the original friend-group repository and use the text in the description to link your PR to this issue `Answers neuroinformatics-unitrse-best-practices-playground#3`.
Think of the benefits and drawbacks of this approach compared to the original version.
If you have time, think of other changes you consider useful and try them.
